# DiceGame
This is a dice game. It allows you to roll dice randomly and then declare the winner. I used the random function to handle randomness and DOM manipulation functions to target the dice image that corresponds to the random value.
It’s a dice-rolling game. To use it, is very simple. 
1)You download the file in the place of your choice. 
2)Decompress file 
3)And open the index.html file in your navigator.
4)Refresh your navigator to bigin playing.
